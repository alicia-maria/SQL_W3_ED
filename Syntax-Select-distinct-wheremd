# Introduction 

## What is SQL ?
- Stands for Structured Query Language 
- Lets you access and manipulate databases

## What can SQL do?
- Execute queries against a database
- Can retrieve data from a database 
- Insert , update, delete records 
- Can create databases
- Create stored procedures 
- Create views in database
- Set permissions on tables. Procedures, and view

## All must support basic commands 
1. SELECT
1. UPDATE
1. DELETE
1. INSERT
1. WHERE
1. DISTINCT 

## RDMS
- Stands for relational database management system 
- RDMS are the basic for SQL and for all modern database systems 
- Data in RDBMS are stored as *database objects* called tables
- *Tables* are a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows 
- Tables are broken into smaller entities called *fields* which describe a specific attribute about a row also known as a *record*. Records contain unique values about an individual entry
 
# SQL Syntax 

## SQL Statements 
Statements consist of keywords that are easy to understand 
	SELECT * FROM customers; 
** This statement will grab all the information from the customers table 

## Database tables 
- Often contain one or more tables
- Tables are identified by a specific name and contains records with unique data 

## Semicolon after SQL statements?
- Some but not all database systems might require a semicolon [;] at the end of each statement
- Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database system and allows more than 1 SQL statement to be executed at the the same time from a server

Important Commands and Meaning
SELECT = extract data from database 
UPDATE = updates data in a database
DELETE = delta data in a database 
INSERT INTO = adds new data into a database 
CREATE DATABASE = creates new database 
ALTER DATABASE = modifies a database 
CREATE TABLE = creates a new table 
ALTER TABLE - creates a new table 
DROP TABLE = deletes a database 
CREATE INDEX = creates an index 
DRP INDEX = deletes index 
DISTINCT = will pull from a table that are different 

# SQL [ SELECT ] Statements 

## SELECT - Statements 
Are used to select data from a database 

## SELECT *all* columns 
If you want to select all column from a specific table you can used 
SELECT * 

If you want to select specific field from a table you would use the following syntax
	SELECT column1, column2, …
FROM table_name;

Ex - SELECT City , Zipcode FROM Customers; 

If you want data from that same table with different [unique/ different] records you would do 
SELECT DISTINCT 

Syntax 
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

Ex - SELECT DISTINCT country FROM Customers; 

By using DISTINCT we can call a function called COUNT 

COUNT = allows us to return the number of different countries stored within a table 

Syntax
 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers

# SQL Where Clause 
## WHERE 
Is used to filter records 
It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition 

Syntax 
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

 Ex - SELECT * FROM Customers
      WHERE Country='Mexico';
- WHERE is not an exclusive clause to SELECT statements 
- WHERE can also be used in UPDATE and DELETE ect. Commands.

## Text fields V. Numeric fields 
- SQL requires [‘] around ‘TEXT VALUES’ 
- SQL requires for numerical field NOT to be enclosed with quotes 

Syntax 
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID=1;

In where statements you can use more that just [ = ] functions you can do more specific searches such as the following…

Syntax 
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID > 80;
